## Attacks

**Defacement**

- Online vandalism, replacing legit pages with illegit ones.

**Phishing & Spear Phishing**

- Spoofed website that appears to look real, emails sent to people asking them to log in with their info with a socially engineered message.
- Point is to get the user to enter their credentials so the attacker can log into the bank itself and transfer money out of their account.
- Spear phishing are more targeted phishing attacks.
- Has been used in many attacks to the point that many companies will test their employees to see how susceptible they are to phishing and get them more paranoid and aware of phishing.

**Malware**

- Malicious software
- Compromise a machine by running software that the attacker controls
- Floppy disks > Attachments to emails > Drive-by-download
- Phishing and malware used together - download malware via phishing email
- Worms - first was Morris worm, then Nimbda, Code Red, WannaCry. Infect machines and ask for ransom.

## Interview from Industry (Google’s Security Princess, Parisa)

- This wasn’t something Parisa was exposed to as a kid
- Didn’t have programming experience but chose engineering in college because she didn’t know what to do
- She was drawn to math and science in high school
- Taught herself programming to learn web development
- Learning HTML and CSS for building websites
- Moved into taking more CS and learning web dev from free resources
- Had a personal homepage that was hacked, input validation attack - a date format was assumed for some variables, but input validation was not being conducted
- Input validation is the root of most security problems
- Being interested in web security was new, and there was a sentiment is was lame, but it was what Parisa knew and what she was experimenting with
- From that, she continued to learn more about security, how to leverage little bugs and make software do things that weren’t intended
- She got an internship with a national lab and was able to do security research, gave her a taste of academia and allowed her to meet a lot of other researchers
- Having experience outside of the classroom made her realize she could have a career outside of this
- One of the reasons she loves working in Chrome is that she loves being able to share what’s being learned with the world
- There’s more demand than supply for security

# Cybersecurity & Executive Strategy

## Security and the Board

- Why it’s important - trend of mega breaches where many companies have been getting breached, customer records and source code getting stolen.
- Important for boards of companies to have the appropriate oversight around security.
- Living at a time in history where the Internet has been commercialized. Compared to other innovations (automobiles, electricity), the rate at which issues were resolved didn’t require as swift action.
- The original internet protocols didn’t have as much safety and security from the start, have had to build that up.
- Security is a characteristic that’s inherent in a product
- When engaging the board of directors, it’s good to know who’s on the board. Who do they hold accountable for security at the organization? CISO, CIO, CSO, CEO.
- Breach of Target, not just CSO but CEO also held accountable.
- Audit committee - subset of board members that’s responsible for understanding the results of financial audits
- Some companies have been creating risk committees - concerned with a variety of risks, competitive, product, infosec
- Does the company have a CSO or CISO? CISO focuses on information/data assets, CSO may focus more on physical security.
- How technical or non-technical is your board of directors? What should a CSO or chief security person report at that level? Status of technical vulnerabilities? What are they interested in? Higher level questions about level of risk based on threats? Technical information only might not be helpful as higher level information about risk.
- Doe your org have an exec dashboard for security?
- If you’re working on security and info tech, what kinds of things should you be reporting up to an exec level dashboard?
- Important questions for mddle managers - where is security with regard to the corporate agenda? Security should be prioritized very highly.
- How do you measure how good the security is at the organization such that it can flow into exec level reporting?

## Principles

- 2014 Report
- If you are a director on a board, that’s a significant responsibility. Part of your job is to help that company manage risks. This is not just an issue about info security, authentication. There are a lot of facets of risk, and Security is an enterprise wide issue.
- When it comes to Security, there’s a whole set of legal considerations, regulations that apply. It’s important for directors to understand the legal implications of cybersecurity risks. Is a breach considered negligence, for example. What counts as a data breach and what are the different state laws around them? Is there an incident and particular legal protocols around it?
- Boards should have adequate access to cybersecurity expertise. Taking a course like this is one approach. Should have access and ability to have discussions about cybersecurity and risk management, experts within and outside of the company, regular time for discussion on board meeting agendas.
- Directors should set expectation that there should be an enterprise wide framework that’s deployed, e.g., NIST cybersecurity framework, ISO. There should be adequate staffing and budget.
